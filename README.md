# Model Template for Residential Energy Supply Systems (MTRESS)

This is a generic model for [oemof.solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph/)
that provides a variety of possible technology combinations for energy supply systems.
It is tailored for optimising controll strategies fulfilling fiexed demand time series
for electricity, heat, and domestic hot water using any selected combination
of the implemented supply technologies.

The development was partly funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)
and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany
in the project ENaQ (project number 03SBE111).
